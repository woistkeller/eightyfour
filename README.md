<h2>Structure</h2>

I like to use folders to mimic the structure of the project. So in the components folder, you can find all the global components, and you can scroll through folders to locate how using the application. This way, I can still have different components with different functions with the same name.

In the api folder, each file is for a specific slice of the project.

Redux's configuration follows the documentation: redux store in /app, as does its api folder as well. The slices can be found in /features

<h2>Issues</h2>

All these issues will be resolved over time due to my lack of time, active studies and side projects.
